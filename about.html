Hello! I am a 4th year Computational Media Student at Georgia Tech. Go Jackets!<br>
Through my involvement in the campus all-female A Cappella group, Nothin' But Treble, I have developed my passion for music.
I also got a chance to explore some PR aspects of campus clubs such as Graphics, and Publicity as I led my group as their Music Director.
I would love to be able to apply my skills at a successful company such as Grooveshark! 
</p>
<p class="note"style="font-family:verdana;color:white;">
I am an absolute nature lover. I feel that nature has a lot to offer to us, we just need to explore it to discover its wonders.
I am also a huge tennis fan. I follow professional tennis through out the year. Visiting New York for the US Open tennis Championship last year was a memorable experience for me.
Reading, photography, gardening and music are few of my other interests.</p>
